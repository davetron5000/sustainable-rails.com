            <p class="f6 lh-copy center measure tl">I realize the cost of living outside the United States can be wildly different from living in the U.S. and that a $50 book can be a big investment. I have created several discount codes that will bring the price down to a level that's more in line with the purchasing power in your country.</p>
            <p class="f6 lh-copy center measure tl">It's not perfect, and you are on your honor to choose the best discount for where you live. Visit <a href="https://naildrivin5.com/books/index.html#pricing" target="_new">my website</a> for more info and then use the best code <a href="https://sowl.co/boqdo7" class="link underline">at checkout</a> for the eBook. If you are buying the <a href="https://bit.ly/sustainable-rails-print" class="link underline">print book from Amazon</a>, I have adjusted the pricing in Amazon already, though Amazon only allows me to set pricing for certain countries.</p>

          <p class="lh-copy measure">My name is David Bryant Copeland and I've spent the last nine years working on long-lived Rails apps. I've worked on a huge monolith whose construction was not managed as well as greenfield apps that evolved over many years from monoliths to a microservices architecture.</p>
          <p class="lh-copy measure">13 years prior to that I worked on various technologies and apps both for consulting clients and startups. Lastly, I've advised several startups using Rails and seen first-hand how small mistakes made early on can have a cascading effect on team sustainabilty.</p>
          <p class="lh-copy measure">The content of this book is based on my actual experience‚ÄîI've really done everything in the book. I've seen (and made) decisions that both lead to great sustianbility as well as harmed it. There's nothing theoretical about what's in the book.</p>
          <p class="lh-copy measure">Feel free to look at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcopeland" class="link underline light-blue">my resume</a> to see what my experience is. I've also authored several technical books, including <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/rails6" class="link underline light-blue">Agile Web Development with Rails 6</a>, <a href="http://www.theseniorsoftwareengineer.com/" class="link underline light-blue">The Senior Software Engineer</a>, and <a href="https://solid-is-not-solid.com" class="link underline light-blue">SOLID is not Solid</a>.
