        </h2>
        <p class="lh-copy measure">You should have been given a link and a code to "buy" the book for free. To use it:</p>
        <ol>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">Go <a href="https://transactions.sendowl.com/products/78209878/C293F8D6/add_to_cart">here</a> to add the book to your cart.</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">Click ‚ÄúCheckout‚Äù.</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">Click ‚ÄúGot a code‚Äù.</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">Enter the code I gave you.</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">Click ‚Äúupdate‚Äù.</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">Enter your email and click ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="lh-copy measure">This should download a <space class="courier">.zip</space> file that contains the book. There is a PDF, an EPUB, a Kindle version, and a text version.</p>

        <h2 class="f4">Reviewing/Feedback <span aria-label="thinking-face" role="img">üßê</span>
        </h2>
        <p class="lh-copy measure">The most important question I need answered is: <strong>is the code and text technically correct?</strong> To the extent that any objective statement exists in the book, <strong>is that objectively correct?</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="lh-copy measure">Also of note is that the book is strongly opinionated and prescriptive and this is on purpose. I'm not trying to make a book for all people and all situations. I am totally fine if you do not agree with some of the advice in the book, and if you want to tell me about that disagreement, that's fine :)</p>
        <p class="lh-copy measure">Given that, the following are some guidelines to help you help me.</p>
        <a name="giving-feedback">¬†</a>
        <h3 class="f5">How to Give feedback</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">Try to read the PDF version if you can.</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">You can <a href="mailto:davec@naildrivin5.com">email me feedback</a> any time and in any form if that works for you.</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">You can <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/slacktron5000/shared_invite/enQtOTcwOTEwMjgzNzUxLTU5NTIxNWZiM2Q2MTEzZjA3YWM2M2U4NzNkMzhlYjdmNzQwZjMyOGRmYmUzOTg3YWM4MGM5YzBkZGRmNzZhNzc">contact me on Slack</a> if you like.</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">Try to indicate the page number or section heading of the area about which you have feedback. <span class="f6 gray">Reference points in EPUB or Kindle won't translate for me in all likelihood.</span>
          </li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">Don't feel like you have to read it all. If you scan the table of contents and decide you only have time to focus on, say, the section on Helpers, that's cool.</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">If you have opinions about what <strong>should</strong> be in the chapters you haven't read, that's cool, too.</li>
        </ul>
        <a name="responding">¬†</a>
        <h3 class="f5">How I'll Respond</h3>
        <ul>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">If I don't hear from you at all, I will ask for feedback one time, as a reminder. No offense will be taken if you don't respond and/or can't get to it.</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">I may have questions about your feedback. I will ask those questions once. You should not feel obligated to respond and I won't be offended if you don't. I will not hound you for answers.</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">When all is said and done and the book is complete, I'll ask for your mailing address to send you a physical copy of the book. I'll just ask once and won't hassle you.</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">If I can help you in the future in any way, please ask. Not sure <strong>what</strong> I can help with, but I will try.</li>
        </ul>
        <a name="guide">¬†</a>
        <h3 class="f5">Questions to Guide Feedback</h3>
        <p class="lh-copy measure">I don't need these answered, but if you need some structure on how to give me feedback, these might help.</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">Can you follow the book and understand the advice it's imparting?</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">Is any of the code, statements about code, or statements about Rails that are incorrect?</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">Are there any points that land particularly strongly or that don't land that well?</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">Does any of the advice seem particularly apt and track with your experience?</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">Does any of the advice seem counter to your experience?</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">What situations have you experienced where some of the book's advice doesn't apply or should not be followed?</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">Of what the current version of the book covers, is anything missing?</li>
        </ul>
        <a name="non-feedback">¬†</a>
        <h3 class="f5">Things I Don't Need Feedback On <span aria-label="nope-lady" role="img">üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</span>
        </h3>
        <p class="lh-copy measure">This book is a work in progress, and I'm aware of some of the issues that exist, so you don't have to give me feedback on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">The browser screenshots missing a border or being too big</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">Code running into the margins</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">Multiple code snippets on the same file when one will do. I'll be improving my ability to reference code to be better.</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">Code snippets missing filenames. I'll be adding those eventually.</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">Typos. I know some of you process writing by pointing out typos and that's totally fine if you want to pass them along, but don't look for them if it's not natural to you.</li>
          <li class="lh-copy measure">An excess of commas. I use too many, I know. I'll sort it out :)</li>
